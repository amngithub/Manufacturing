# Manufacturing
Manufacturing is an industry with many moving parts: human resources, raw materials, capital investments, production equipment, logistics—not to mention ever-changing customer demands. Data gets created at every turn, but it often stays in silos, limited in its utility. This holds true for all manufacturers—whether aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial machinery, or mill products.
